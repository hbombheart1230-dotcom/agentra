    """Call only after existing policy approval; never bypass those guards.

    This is the single canonical claim-dispatch-finish sequence for every
    real broker mutation path in this codebase (Step5C Fix2 HIGH1): there
    is deliberately no "state already reads EXECUTING, so just dispatch"
    shortcut anywhere else in this codebase (see libs/skills/runner.py) --
    reading a state value is not ownership evidence. The only way to
    legitimately reach executor.execute() below is to win the atomic
    claim_execution() CAS in *this* call.

    Composed with a second, independent guard (Fix2 HIGH3): claim_execution
    guarantees at most one owner per intent_id, but two different intent_id
    values (e.g. the automated content-hash scheme and the manual approval
    uuid4 scheme) can still describe the same real-world physical order.
    claim_physical_order is checked first and guarantees at most one active
    lease per physical order shape, independent of intent_id or which path
    is asking. The physical lease is deliberately not auto-released on an
    ambiguous outcome (crash, UNKNOWN, persistence failure) -- only a
    genuine terminal state (EXECUTED/FAILED) releases it, matching this
    module's existing no-implicit-replay philosophy.

    normalize is the caller's existing Step5B outcome normalization boundary.
    No transport classification is invented by this ownership layer.

    R6.1 (final mutation choke point): for production-capable BUY/SELL (real execution mode, new
    exposure) the caller must pass ``readiness_evidence`` -- the reference returned by the shared R6
    pre-admission helper together with this attempt's ``execution_attempt_id``. It is verified against
    durable storage here (a hash-valid pre_broker_submit ALLOW record bound to this intent AND this exact
    attempt, runtime instance and ownership generation) and the CURRENT canonical owner / readiness /
    recovery state must still match it (R6.2: evidence is proof, never a reusable capability token; there
    is no age-based authorization). Missing/invalid/stale -> fail closed BEFORE any
    Step5C claim and with no broker call. This grants no authority: readiness/guard decisions stay
    with their existing owners; this only proves the evidence contract was satisfied.
