"""Durable UNKNOWN-broker-outcome quarantine (Phase 1 Step 5B).

Extracted from graphs/nodes/execute_from_packet.py (Phase 1 Step 5B Fix 3)
so every live path that can physically submit a broker mutation shares the
*same* durable per-symbol lock state -- not just the canonical
execute_from_packet.py guard chain, but also
libs/skills/runner.py::CompositeSkillRunner (reached via
libs/tools/tool_facade.py::ToolFacade.order_execute and
libs/agent/executor/executor_agent.py::ExecutorAgent), which previously
never checked or wrote this state at all. A symbol quarantined by one path
is now respected by the other, and vice versa.

Behavior is unchanged from the Step 5B Safety Fix 2 design (commit
6b17925) for the existing execute_from_packet.py call sites -- this is an
extraction, not a redesign:

- Fail-closed decisions are based on the per-symbol lock file's
  *existence*, never on successfully parsing its content.
- The lock file is created atomically (O_CREAT|O_EXCL) and never
  auto-deleted by any code path here.
- If durable persistence itself fails (disk full / permission denied),
  the process-wide GLOBAL_MUTATION_HALT activates as a last-resort
  fallback that blocks every mutation regardless of symbol.

New in Fix 3: GLOBAL_MUTATION_HALT is additionally backed by a durable,
atomically-created marker file (same existence-based contract as a
per-symbol lock), so a process restart also fails closed instead of
silently losing the halt the moment the in-memory flag is gone.

New in Fix 4 (HIGH4): the durable marker from Fix 3 lives under the same
quarantine directory as per-symbol locks, so a single filesystem-level
failure (disk full, permission change, directory corruption) affecting
that directory could fail both writes at once, leaving no
restart-survivable trace. The marker is now additionally written to a
second, independent path -- the OS temp directory (`tempfile.gettempdir()`,
the same primitive already used for pytest isolation in
libs/core/path_isolation.py, not a new subsystem) -- so a restart still
fails closed as long as at least one of the two locations is writable.
This does NOT protect against a true whole-machine storage outage (both
locations typically resolve to the same physical volume on a single-disk
host); see `activate_global_mutation_halt`'s docstring and Step 5B Fix 4's
report for the honestly-scoped residual risk that remains.

New in Fix 5 (HIGH, closes the last Fix 4 audit finding): the Fix 4
fallback marker used the real OS temp directory unconditionally, which a
pytest run and a live production process both resolve to the exact same
path -- so a pytest run could delete a real production halt marker, and a
marker a pytest run created could be picked up by a live production
process as a genuine global mutation halt. The fallback location now
branches on the existing pytest-session detection
(`libs.core.path_isolation.running_under_pytest`): under pytest it
resolves under that same module's per-session isolated write root
(`_pytest_isolated_write_root`, already used to isolate every other
runtime write pytest makes), never the real OS temp path; outside pytest
(production) it is byte-for-byte the same path Fix 4 always used. No new
isolation mechanism was introduced.
