# resolve_runtime_write_path would have redirected every test's own
# tmp_path-based path a second time and broken it (caught directly by the
# dedicated regression test tests/test_p0_pytest_isolation_fix2.py::
# test_resolve_runtime_write_path_passes_through_tmp_path when an earlier
# basetemp-uniqueness fix briefly broke the exact-string match below).
#
# Current state (pytest-artifact-hygiene follow-up): conftest.py::
# pytest_configure now points basetemp at an OS-temp, per-process directory
# (never repo-local), specifically to stop pytest temp output from
# accumulating inside the repository. A live tmp_path therefore now
# resolves *outside* the repo, and is instead handled by
# resolve_runtime_write_path's own "genuinely outside the repository"
# branch further down (Path.relative_to(repo_root) raising ValueError) --
# this exception is dormant for that case now, but is kept, unmodified,
# for .pytest_cache/__pycache__ and as a defensive fallback should any
# caller ever again resolve a path under a literal repo-relative
# .pytest-work-style directory. _is_pytest_owned_subdir below matches the

    isolate_canonical_path_for_pytest only redirects a path that matches one
    specific, named canonical literal -- exactly right for call sites that
    know their canonical default up front, but it does nothing for a writer
    whose default is *some* repository-relative path the caller doesn't
    enumerate ahead of time (e.g. a root-level literal like "b.jsonl", or an
    explicit-but-still-production-relative argument passed straight through
    without any isolation check at all -- both confirmed leak patterns).

    Under pytest: any relative path, or any absolute path that resolves
    *inside this repository*, is redirected under one isolated root shared
    for the lifetime of this pytest process, preserving the path's relative
    structure so different callers still land in distinct files instead of
    colliding into one.

    An absolute path that resolves *outside* the repository -- which is
    exactly what every pytest ``tmp_path`` value is -- passes through
    unchanged. This is what keeps this function from redirecting a test's
    own explicit tmp_path arguments; without it, every existing test that
    builds its own tmp_path-based path would break.

    Containment is re-verified after the join (Phase 1 P0 corrective commit,
    item 1): naive string/Path concatenation of an untrusted, possibly
    hostile input (``..`` traversal, a Windows drive-relative path like
    ``"C:data\\x.json"``, or a rooted-but-driveless path like
    ``"\\data\\x.json"``) can escape the isolated root entirely -- pathlib's
    join operator has special, easy-to-get-wrong semantics for exactly
    these forms, and ``Path.is_absolute()`` returns False for the latter
    two even though they behave like absolute paths once joined. Rather
    than trying to enumerate and special-case every such form up front,
    the joined result is resolved and checked to actually be a descendant
    of the isolated root; anything that fails that check is redirected to
    a deterministic, always-contained fallback location instead of ever
    being handed back to the caller.

    Outside pytest this is a no-op (returns the path unchanged) -- it never
    alters production behavior.
