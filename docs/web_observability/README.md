The product is not an evaluation-progress dashboard. It presents performance,
trades, opportunities, strategies, market context, LLM operations, reports,
and data-quality signals. Evaluation artifacts are internal evidence sources.

M7.1 adds one operational exception to that product summary: a compact,
read-only Trading Main status. It normalizes Windows parent/child processes to
one logical session and exposes no start, stop, restart, kill, or order action.

M7.2 keeps that UI read-only while extending the existing Windows scheduled
watchdog with bounded recovery for stopped, heartbeat-stale, duplicated, and
ownership-inconsistent Main sessions. Every watchdog decision is retained as
history and shown on Overview; the API still exposes no control endpoint.

M7.3 reuses the existing Preopen and Closeout pipelines to materialize an
operator briefing, daily intelligence index, scheduled job manifests and a
memory delivery receipt. It adds no scheduler task and no LLM call.

No document in this folder authorizes trading, evaluation, prompt, execution,
or runtime behavior changes.
