## M1 Added Surface

```text
apps/api/
  config.py
  main.py
  infrastructure/
    bounded_reader.py
    paths.py
    source_roots.py
  models/
    common.py
    health.py
  routers/
    health.py
  services/
    health.py
```

Endpoints:

```text
GET /health/live
GET /health/ready
```

No API server was left running. Validation used in-process FastAPI test clients
only.

## Isolation Result

* Trading Core imports: 0
* existing evaluation imports: 0
* existing Operator UI imports: 0
* network/broker/LLM imports: 0
* filesystem write calls: 0
* non-GET API routes: 0
* existing Trading Runtime files changed by tests: 0

The source-root response exposes logical names only (`reports`, `logs`,
`state`). It does not expose absolute host paths.

## Verification

```text
new API tests: 13 passed, 1 skipped
existing Operator UI regression: 51 passed
compileall apps/api: passed
```

The skipped test is the Windows symlink-escape test because the current user
cannot create the test symlink. Normal traversal and absolute-path tests pass,
and `Path.resolve()` plus root-relative validation implements the same runtime
guard.

## Live Runtime Non-Interference Check

Before:

```text
captured: 09:38:29 KST
Trading Runtime PID: 760
events.jsonl size: 866,277,396
Q9 decision-window size: 4,657,355
working set: 185,712,640 bytes
```

After:

```text
captured: 09:43:20 KST
Trading Runtime PID: 760
process responding: true
events.jsonl size: 867,057,791
Q9 decision-window size: 5,400,401
working set: 188,522,496 bytes
```

The PID remained unchanged, heartbeat remained active, and both live evidence
streams continued to grow during tests. No API background process was started.

## Dirty Worktree Boundary

The following paths existed as unrelated uncommitted work before M1 and were
not modified as part of the Web/API implementation:

```text
docs/runtime_memory/**
libs/reporting/evaluation/memory_review/**
scripts/run_memory_contamination_review.py
tests/test_memory_contamination_review.py
```

Future Web/API scope audits must compare against this baseline instead of
treating those pre-existing paths as changes made by the observability work.

## M2 Added Surface

M2 is complete. It added the following isolated API surface:

```text
GET /api/v1/overview?day=YYYY-MM-DD
GET /api/v1/portfolio?day=YYYY-MM-DD
GET /api/v1/performance/summary?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD
GET /api/v1/performance/series?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD
```

M2 uses `performance_summary.v1` rows whose `return_basis` is
`truth_surface_net`. It does not merge lifecycle-only or observed shadow
returns into realized performance. Period results deduplicate `trade_id`.

Supported result basis:

```text
MOCK_BROKER_NET: available when truth-surface samples exist
GROSS: unavailable from the current source
LIVE_EQUIVALENT_NET: unavailable from the current source
```

Absolute realized PnL is exposed only when the trusted trade row contains
`pnl`. Gross PnL, explicit total cost, cost drag, and current open orders remain
`UNAVAILABLE`; they are never represented as zero.

Portfolio data is projected from the daily operator summary's reconciled
residual-position read model. The raw Kiwoom account snapshot is not read by
request handlers because the audited files can contain invalid JSON after
legacy Korean-title encoding corruption. See
`m2_source_audit_2026-08-14.md`.

## M2 Verification

```text
Web/API tests: 24 passed, 1 skipped
existing Operator UI regression: 51 passed
compileall apps/api: passed
actual 2026-06-01..2026-07-31 read: 110 trades, 81 trusted returns
actual 2026-08-01..2026-08-13 series: NO_DATA, not a fabricated zero return
```

M2 verification used in-process clients only. No API server or background job
was started.

Live-runtime comparison after M2:

```text
Trading Runtime PID: 760 (unchanged)
process responding: true
heartbeat active: true
events.jsonl grew from 867,487,495 to 870,112,893 bytes
working set: 193,662,976 bytes
```

## Next Gate

M3 is complete. It added:

```text
GET /api/v1/trades
GET /api/v1/trades/{trade_id}
GET /api/v1/trades/{trade_id}/reports
GET /api/v1/trades/{trade_id}/reports/{report_id}
```

The list and detail surfaces provide symbol identity, themes, broker-net
result, strategy/tactic/horizon, Scanner rank, entry/hold/exit timeline,
post-exit checkpoints, agent-source integrity, and evaluation exclusion state.

M3 never reads these large or sensitive source families:

```text
lifecycle_bundle.json
ai_trade_report_input.json
raw LLM response JSON
events.jsonl
```

Report access uses fixed identifiers. Arbitrary relative paths are not accepted,
host paths are redacted, JSON path/prompt/response/order fields are removed,
and report reads remain size-bounded.

## M3 Verification

```text
Web/API tests: 35 passed, 1 skipped
existing Operator UI regression: 51 passed
compileall apps/api: passed
actual 2026-06-01..2026-07-31 trade list: 110 rows
trade bundle rows: 86
performance fallback rows: 24
fully available display rows: 8
partial display rows: 102
```

The API preserves all 110 performance-ledger trade identities instead of
silently dropping the 24 rows without a usable trade bundle. Fallback rows are
explicitly labeled `PERFORMANCE_FALLBACK` and do not fabricate a timeline.
See `m3_trade_source_audit_2026-08-14.md`.

## M4 Added Surface

```text
GET /api/v1/opportunities/funnel
GET /api/v1/opportunities/outcomes
GET /api/v1/strategies/performance
GET /api/v1/market/snapshot
GET /api/v1/market/series
```

Opportunity responses distinguish shadow/observation evidence from realized
performance and retain gross, live-equivalent, and mock-broker cost surfaces.
Strategy performance reuses the M3 normalized trade read model. Market APIs
read only bounded daily macro snapshots and never call external providers.

## M4 Verification

```text
Web/API tests: 43 passed, 1 skipped
existing Operator UI regression: 51 passed
compileall apps/api: passed
actual 2026-08-13 opportunity signals: 168 total, 3 current symbols
actual 2026-08-13 opening outcomes: 8 rows, 39/40 checkpoints observed
actual 2026-06-01..2026-07-31 strategy rows: 110 trades
actual 2026-08-14 market metrics: 15/15 available
```

See `m4_opportunity_strategy_market_source_audit_2026-08-14.md` for authority,
coverage, and request-time exclusion details.

M5 is the next gate. It builds the independent Web UI over the frozen M0-M4
API contracts. It must remain operational and presentation focused rather than
becoming an evaluation-progress dashboard.

## M5 Added Surface

M5 adds `apps/web` with eight product pages:

```text
Overview
Performance
Trades
Opportunities
Strategies
Market
Reports
Data Quality
```

The Web uses React, TypeScript, Vite, Lucide icons, and Recharts. Feature pages
are lazy-loaded and split by domain. There are no mutation controls or direct
artifact reads.

## M5 Verification

```text
Web unit tests: 3 passed
Web strict TypeScript and production build: passed
Browser smoke: 16 desktop/mobile route renders passed
Console/page errors: 0
Horizontal document overflow: 0
API readiness through Web proxy: AVAILABLE
```

Local processes were started without restarting Trading Runtime:

```text
Web: http://127.0.0.1:5173
API: http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

See `m5_web_ui_implementation_2026-08-14.md` for the screen, module, safety,
and verification details.

## M5.1 LLM Operations

M5.1 adds a ninth `LLM Operations` page and a single read-only endpoint:

```text
GET /api/v1/llm/operations?day=YYYY-MM-DD
```

Daily call/model/status authority comes from stage-specific `reports/llm`
artifacts. Recent latency comes from a bounded event-log tail. Missing token
and cost fields remain unavailable rather than becoming false zero values.

The page explicitly distinguishes configured models from selected-day observed
models and reports the current trade-report MiniMax/Nemotron route mismatch.
No prompts, response text, credentials, or internal paths are returned.

See `m5_1_llm_operations_implementation_2026-08-14.md` for the complete source,
availability, UI, and verification contract.

## M6 Anomaly and Public Profile

M6 adds:

```text
GET /api/v1/anomalies?day=YYYY-MM-DD
GET /api/v1/profile
```

The anomaly surface detects runtime freshness, artifact-integrity warnings,
cost-drag spikes, same-symbol repeated losses, sub-60-second loss exits, and
observed shadow opportunity misses. It is explicitly observation-only and
returns its evidence and fixed threshold with every signal.

The public profile is selected server-side with
`OBSERVABILITY_EXPOSURE_PROFILE=public`. It preserves the private profile's
metric formulas, identifies all results as simulation/mock, blocks report
content before reading it, removes sensitive identifiers and values from JSON,
and hides private-only navigation.

Implementation and policy details are fixed in
`m6_anomaly_public_profile_implementation_2026-08-14.md`.

## M6 Verification

```text
API regression: 57 passed, 1 skipped
Web unit tests: 3 passed
Strict TypeScript and production build: passed
Browser smoke: 10 routes x desktop/mobile = 20 renders passed
Public-profile navigation/mode browser check: passed
Trading Core imports from apps/api: 0
non-GET routes: 0
filesystem write-call isolation scan: passed
```

Actual artifact smoke:

```text
2026-07-21 trades evaluated: 1
warnings classified: 2
categories: COST_SPIKE, EARLY_LOSS_EXIT
policy: operational_anomaly.v1
```

Live-runtime comparison:

```text
before event size: 908,210,563 bytes at 12:52:02 KST
after event size:  909,484,892 bytes at 13:00:06 KST
Trading Runtime PID: 760 before and after
Trading Runtime responding: true
API profile after verification: private
API readiness: AVAILABLE
Web/API listeners: 127.0.0.1:5173 and 127.0.0.1:8000
```

The API process was replaced to load M6. The Trading Runtime and Web process
were not restarted.

## M7 Weekend Gate

The 2026-08-14 host audit confirmed Windows 11 Home 64-bit, 15.5 GB memory,
220.2 GB free storage, and an active hypervisor. On 2026-08-26 Docker Desktop
4.88.1, Docker CLI 29.7.2, Compose v5.4.0, and kubectl v1.36.1 were installed.
The required restart completed on 2026-08-26 and WSL2/Linux Docker Engine are
active.

M7 source implementation was completed on 2026-08-18 without changing or
restarting the Trading Runtime. It includes only Web and read-only API
containers. Trading Runtime remains on the Windows host through M9 and may
enter a separate shadow-first container migration track afterward.

Implemented:

* minimal non-root API and multi-stage Web images;
* Dockerfile-specific build-context allowlists;
* localhost-only Web publication with a private API service;
* read-only reports, logs, state, and evidence mounts;
* read-only root filesystems, tmpfs, dropped capabilities, and resource limits;
* private default and public sanitization override;
* deterministic deployment-contract tests.

Pre-engine verification:

```text
tests/apps/api + tests/deploy: 64 passed, 1 skipped
existing API health/live: 200
existing API health/ready: 200
existing Web root: 200
Trading Runtime restart: none
```

Completed after the required Windows restart:

* WSL2 status and Linux Docker Engine confirmation;
* `docker compose build/up/ps`;
* container health and read-only mount write-denial proof;
* private/public profile and desktop/mobile browser smoke;
* Compose down isolation proof.

See `m7_prerequisites_and_weekend_plan_2026-08-14.md` for the fixed weekend
work slices, external-access boundary, and future runtime migration gates.
See `m7_docker_compose_implementation_2026-08-18.md` for the implemented file
surface and completed engine-validation gate.
See `m7_engine_gate_2026-08-26.md` for the installed versions, current
post-restart results and final M7 evidence.
## M7.2 Host Supervisor (2026-08-27)

Completed:

* five-minute Windows watchdog now detects stopped, stale-heartbeat,
  duplicate-session, and lock-owner mismatch states;
* recovery is limited to three attempts per day with a ten-minute cooldown;
* watchdog decisions are stored as per-run history artifacts;
* read-only runtime status and watchdog-history APIs expose policy state;
* Overview shows current recovery usage and recent before/after checks;
* no trading, scanner, strategist, monitor, order, or Docker runtime behavior
  was changed.

Verification: runtime/API regression `81 passed, 1 skipped`; strict TypeScript
and production Docker image build passed.
