# Q9 Evaluation Layer

Current compact Q9-Q18 authority map:

- `q9_q18_operating_status_2026-08-05.md`

This folder owns the post-Q8 evaluation layer.

## Current Authority

Read `current_operating_baseline.md` first.

Current status as of 2026-06-23:

- Q8 tactical validation is closed.
- Existing Q8 shadow collectors may continue as Q9 evidence providers.
- Q9 read-only system evaluation is active.
- Q9 P/A/B/C decision-window instrumentation is implemented.
- 2026-06-23 is an instrumentation/application day and is excluded from the
  formal sample.
- The next full regular-session trading day is Day 1 of the fixed five-valid-
  trading-day forward window.
- No runtime behavior change is authorized.

Q8 answers:

> Did a specific tactical gate or entry lane behave as expected?

Q9 answers:

> Did the complete decision system create measurable trading value?

Q9 evaluates Commander, Strategist, Scanner, Monitor, execution, Reporter
feedback, and their interactions. It does not create a new trading tactic and
does not replace Q8.

## Fixed Program Names

- Q9: `Multi-Agent Attribution Evaluation`
- Q10: `Samsung/Hynix Large-Cap Baseline Control`
- Q11: `Opening Surge & Market Reversal Research` (`09:00-10:00 KST`)

Q10 and Q11 are independent shadow programs running in parallel with Q9. They
are not sequential replacements for Q9.

## Hard Boundary

Q9 is read-only until a separate promotion review is approved.

Q9 must not directly change:

- entry or exit eligibility
- tactic selection
- Scanner ranking
- Monitor thresholds
- Commander approval
- position sizing
- Strategist prompts
- feedback injection
- order placement

## Operating Principle

Q9 does not wait indefinitely for perfect live-trade samples.

## Running The Evaluation

```powershell
venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\run_q9_evaluation.py --date YYYY-MM-DD --reports-root reports
```

Generated outputs are written only below:

```text
reports/evaluation/
```

The command does not import or modify Commander, Strategist, Scanner, Monitor,
or execution behavior.

## Implementation Status

As of 2026-06-19:

- artifact inventory is implemented
- Q9 trade read model and broker-truth exit overlay are implemented
- trade evaluation is implemented
- Scanner/Strategist/Commander attribution records are implemented
- daily and 5/10/20-day rolling scorecards are implemented
- Strategist and feedback effectiveness surfaces are implemented
- the latest 10 artifact-bearing trading days were backfilled

The current Q9 instrumentation persists:

- Scanner pre-Strategist source universe and intrinsic Top-20
- Scanner control A
- Strategist-ranked B
- Commander final C
- Top-1/3/5/10 forward outcomes
- source-level forward outcomes

Historical days without these additive fields remain unavailable rather than
being inferred. New runtime windows now add:

- `full_strategist_control_eligibility`: identifies naturally strategy-neutral
  Scanner sourcing cycles without adding a second market-data call
- `feedback_id` and `feedback_application_trace`: links Reporter feedback to a
  later Q9 decision and distinguishes exposure, consumption, and an observed
  frame-change candidate
- memory packet IDs and applied-packet linkage in `memory_usage_trace`

These links improve provenance only. An observed frame change is not causal
proof, and Strategist/feedback economic value remains unavailable until paired
forward outcomes exist.

Unavailable comparisons must remain unavailable. They must not be inferred
from current rank or narrative text.

Q9 is designed to combine:

- realized broker-truth trades
- trusted Q8 shadow outcomes
- Scanner-vs-selected counterfactuals once decision-window links exist
- post-exit outcomes
- integrity confidence

New forward windows link P/A/B/C records to later outcomes. Older records that
predate the instrumentation remain historical context only.

Every result must state whether it is:

- realized evidence
- trusted shadow evidence
- reconstructed counterfactual evidence
- insufficient evidence
