# Offline Alpha Research

This folder contains research that runs outside the live multi-agent trading
path.

Rules:

- no order execution
- no runtime behavior change
- fixed hypotheses and gates before outcome review
- historical minute reconstruction
- live and mock cost bases kept separate
- only evidence-ready candidates may move to controlled adoption

Current research:

- `alpha_research_board_contract_2026-08-27.md`
  - is the sole closeout research authority
  - freezes top-level questions A/B/C, 14 candidate IDs, row columns, and feature columns
  - keeps historical discovery and prospective evidence in separate columns
  - treats Q8-Q18 and all other evaluations as input evidence only
  - accumulates terminal candidates as CLOSED without renaming or restarting them
  - is generated automatically as the final closeout reporting step

- `deep_discriminator_squeeze_2026-08-24.md`
  - consolidates opening, asset-class, Scanner setup, horizon, BTC, and Strategist evidence
  - fixes `HIGH_COMMON_SHORT_ALPHA_V1` as a prospective shadow from 2026-08-25
  - keeps historical discovery and prospective validation samples separate
  - records profit-lock alternatives as non-executable proxies only
  - explicitly preserves Strategist Stage-2 authority

- `immediate_opening_probe_runtime_validation_2026-08-21.md`
  - is the only next fixed runtime validation candidate
  - reuses the existing `IMMEDIATE_OPENING_PROBE` observer without behavior changes
  - runs for five full valid trading days with no automatic extension
  - closes with pass, effect failure, integrity failure, or insufficient sample

- `alpha_research_board_contract_2026-08-21.md`
  - is the superseded v1 four-track contract retained for history
  - consolidates existing historical, validation, and prospective conclusions
  - fixes four research tracks without creating another Q phase
  - separates action review, fixed observation, integrity boundaries, and closed work
  - prevents closed candidates from being retuned or restarted under a new name
  - closes generic `risk_band=HIGH` after contributor-dependence sensitivity failed
  - adds the asset-conditional HIGH common-stock cohort as a new shadow, not a behavior rule
  - is read-only and never authorizes an automatic behavior change

- `opening_rank1_controlled_probe_2026-08-14.md`
  - starts one mock-only controlled behavior experiment on 2026-08-17
  - permits only Scanner Rank-1 `DIRECTIONAL_BREADTH` or
    `FRESH_CHANGE_ACTIVATION` from 09:00 through 09:20
  - keeps cost, chart hard-floor, position, risk-off, order, and exit safety intact
  - caps the lane at one 25%-size probe per day for five full trading days
  - does not promote broad opening entry or alter official policy

- `canonical_rank1_feature_mart_2026-08-11.md`

  - adds a separate `R1_FRESH_CHANGE_ACTIVATION_V1` observer
  - restores canonical Strategist/Scanner and point-in-time chart provenance
  - requires 5 independent day-symbols and stops after at most 10 valid days
  - keeps theme, breadth, chart, recurrence, and quote fields descriptive only

- `rank1_strategy_choice_observability_2026-08-12.md`
  - separates deterministic, LLM-requested, and final market playbooks
  - exposes all 12 tactic options and identifies unscored catalog tactics
  - records whether the selected tactic is only the playbook default
  - compares market tactic family with the observed Rank-1 candidate setup
  - writes daily and cumulative alignment reports without behavior changes

The prospective broad-control gate above does not extend the now-closed five-session
decision window. See `canonical_execution_plan_2026-08-06.md` for the schedule
boundary, `five_session_closure_2026-08-07.md` for the final decision, and
`active_research_register_2026-08-07.md` for the current queue.
