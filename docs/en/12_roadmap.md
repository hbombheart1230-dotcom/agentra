## Post-Step6 and parallel tracks (2026-09-13 consolidation)

This section is the single index for every plan that exists only as
design/research documentation right now. **Nothing in this section has
been implemented, committed as production behavior, or frozen**, except
where a sub-item explicitly says so (Step5B/Step5C only). No code,
runtime, strategy, prompt, evaluation-logic, or execution-logic change is
implied by anything below until its own item says `IMPLEMENTED`.

### Current position (as of 2026-09-13)

| Track | Current status |
|---|---|
| A — Unified Evaluation Foundation (UEF) | UEF-1 Work Package A: **APPROVED / FORMALLY FROZEN** (Codex Final Freeze Audit, 2026-09-13, CRITICAL:0/HIGH:0/MEDIUM:0/LOW:0). UEF-2A (forward semantics inventory + policy contract, no engine): **IN PROGRESS**. UEF-2B..9: **PLANNED**, not started. |
| B — Execution Safety | Step5B: done. Step5C: **frozen** (`docs/development/step5c_execution_owner.md`). Step5D/5E/Step6: **PLANNED**, not started. |
| C — Q100 Alpha Research & Learning Program | **DESIGN STAGE**. See `docs/research/q100_research_and_learning_roadmap.md`. No code. |
| D — Knowledge & Memory Layer / Obsidian UI | **CONCEPT STAGE**. See `docs/architecture/architecture_v2.md` §4.5–§4.9 and §8 (six-layer model). No code, no vault instantiated. |
| Architecture V2 (7-role reclassification, harness principles) | **DESIGN ONLY**, documentation-only relabeling already written; implementation start condition is Step6 `REFACTORING COMPLETE` (unchanged). |

### Track A — UEF-1 through UEF-9 (full plan)

Formal phase definitions live in
[`docs/research/unified_evaluation_foundation.md`](../research/unified_evaluation_foundation.md)
(`## Full UEF roadmap (UEF-1..UEF-9)`). Summary:

| Phase | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| UEF-1 | Canonical evaluation contract/record/identity (Work Package A) | **APPROVED / FORMALLY FROZEN** (2026-09-13) |
| UEF-2 | Canonical forward-return / checkpoint engine | UEF-2A (inventory + policy contract) **IN PROGRESS**; UEF-2B (engine) PLANNED |
| UEF-3 | Canonical cost & metric (WR/PF/Avg/MFE/MAE) engine | PLANNED |
| UEF-4 | Legacy adapter layer (automated legacy-artifact → canonical record) | PLANNED |
| UEF-5 | Historical recompute & dual-run (shadow canonical recompute vs. legacy) | PLANNED |
| UEF-6 | Dedup & evidence lineage (cross-episode double-counting detection) | PLANNED |
| UEF-7 | Alpha Board normalization onto canonical records | PLANNED |
| UEF-8 | Fair-comparison validation (cross-hypothesis comparability gate) | PLANNED |
| UEF-9 | Formal freeze / evaluation authority declaration | PLANNED |

UEF-1 is now formally frozen (Codex Final Freeze Audit, 2026-09-13) and is the
Record/Identity/Relation/Lineage authority for all later UEF phases. UEF-2A
(forward semantics inventory + `ForwardPolicy` contract, no engine) is in
progress under this frozen contract; no phase past UEF-2A has any code.

### Track B — Execution Safety Step5D, Step5E, Step6

| Step | Owns | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Step5D | Broker-truth reconciliation (detect/repair drift between local intent state and actual broker state) | PLANNED, not started |
| Step5E | Safe operator recovery (manual intervention paths that cannot violate Step5B/5C invariants) | PLANNED, not started |
| Step6 | Integrated execution-safety freeze (Step5B+5C+5D+5E declared jointly frozen) | PLANNED, not started |

### Track C — Q100 Alpha Research & Learning Program

Q100-1 through Q100-6 (Research Program Registry, Canonical Evidence
Mapping, Reporter/Evaluator, Knowledge & Memory Layer, Retrieval Layer,
Self-Improvement Loop) are fully defined in
[`docs/research/q100_research_and_learning_roadmap.md`](../research/q100_research_and_learning_roadmap.md).
Design stage only.

### Track D — Knowledge & Memory Layer / Obsidian Knowledge UI

Covered by Architecture V2 §4.5–§4.9 (Experience/Memory Layer, promotion
hierarchy, vault reference layout) and §8 (six-layer system model). Concept
stage only; Obsidian is never operational authority (see prohibition
principles below).

### Dependency graph (all four tracks)

                          |
                          v
   Track C (Q100) can only read from UEF canonical output once UEF-3/UEF-4
   exist; Q100 design work (registry, evidence mapping design) proceeds in
   parallel today, but Q100 execution against real canonical metrics waits
   on UEF-3/UEF-4.
                          |
                          v
   Track D (Knowledge/Memory/Obsidian): memory-write/promotion logic is not
   activated until Track A's evaluation foundation (at least UEF-3) exists
   to write trustworthy `ExperienceRecord.outcome` fields from — see
   prohibition principle 1 below. Vault/UI scaffolding itself may be
   designed in parallel.
```

Track A (UEF) and Track B (Execution Safety) are **independent and may
proceed in parallel** — UEF never touches `libs/execution/*`,
`libs/supervisor/*`, or the Step5B/5C freeze contracts, and Execution
Safety work never touches `libs/reporting/evaluation/canonical/*`.

### Intraday operational principle

The production evaluator/report path runs exactly as it does today,
unchanged, for the entire duration of Tracks A/C/D's build-out. Any
canonical (UEF) recompute runs **shadow/parallel-only** alongside it
(this is UEF-5's explicit job) — canonical output is never substituted
for a production number until UEF-9's formal freeze explicitly says so
for that specific metric.

### Priority tiers (P0 highest)

- **P0** — Execution-safety correctness (Track B) and anything that could
  affect real broker mutation. Always takes precedence over Track A/C/D
  work if they ever conflict for engineering attention.
- **P1** — UEF-1 Codex closure audit resolution (Track A, currently
  blocking UEF-2+).
- **P2** — UEF-2/UEF-3 (canonical forward-return + cost/metric engines) —
  the highest-leverage next UEF step once UEF-1 is closed.
- **P3** — Step5D/Step5E/Step6 (Track B continuation) — independent of P1/P2,
  can run in parallel.
- **P4** — UEF-4..UEF-8 (adapters, dual-run, dedup, Alpha Board
  normalization, fair comparison) and Q100 design-stage work (registry,
  evidence-mapping schema) in parallel.
- **P5** — UEF-9 freeze, Q100 execution against live canonical metrics,
  Knowledge/Memory Layer activation, Obsidian vault instantiation,
  Architecture V2 implementation phases (V2-1..V2-7).

### Prohibition principles (apply to every track above)

1. No memory-learning activation (Q100-4, Q100-6, Architecture V2's
   Experience Memory writes) before the evaluation foundation (at least
   UEF-3) is ready — a promoted "lesson" must trace to a trustworthy
   canonical metric, not a legacy number known to disagree with 4 other
   modules' version of the same metric.
2. Obsidian is never operational authority — it is a UI/exploration layer
   over a plain-Markdown vault; if it is stale, corrupt, or unavailable,
   nothing in Tracks A/B/C changes behavior.
3. The Alpha Research Board never becomes its own metric-calculation
   authority — UEF-3/UEF-7 own metric calculation; the Board only displays
   and (post UEF-7) normalizes onto canonical records.
4. Q100 never recomputes UEF metrics — Q100-2's "Canonical Evidence
   Mapping" reads UEF canonical output; it does not implement a parallel
   forward-return or cost engine.
5. No legacy-evidence deletion during UEF migration — UEF-4/UEF-5 are
   additive; every legacy artifact/report Q9-Q18/Opening Alpha/Alpha
   Board already produced remains untouched and readable.
6. UEF work never arbitrarily changes execution-safety freeze contracts —
   Step5B/5C (and later 5D/5E/Step6) are owned exclusively by Track B;
   Track A has no write access to those contracts, ever.
7. No production strategy auto-modification — Q100-6's Self-Improvement
   Loop is explicitly capped at maturity Level 4-5 (see the Q100 roadmap
   doc) for the foreseeable planning horizon; Level 6-7 (autonomous
   production strategy edits) is out of scope for every track above.

### Execution-safety hardening track (unchanged detail)

- Step5B (done) -> Step5C (frozen, see
  `docs/development/step5c_execution_owner.md`) -> Step5D (broker truth
  reconciliation, not started) -> Step5E (safe operator recovery, not
  started) -> Step6 (integrated execution-safety freeze, not started).
- Post-Step6: Architecture V2 — harness/memory/evaluation modernization.
  See `docs/architecture/architecture_v2.md`. Design only; implementation
  starts only after Step6 `REFACTORING COMPLETE` **and** UEF-9's freeze
  (see dependency graph above). Does not change the Step5D/5E/Step6 order.
